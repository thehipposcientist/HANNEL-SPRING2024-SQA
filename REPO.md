# Activities and Lessons Learned

## Activities

In this project we implement a git hook to check the python files before commiting. In this I used the bandit library to check for things like white space and syntax errors. From here I implemented a file to fuzztest several functions of my own choosing. I also added in for both checks to create error reports on csv files. 

## Lessons Learned

I have been aware through work of workflows but have never directly worked on git hooks or specific pre commit error handeling. This was my favorite portion of working on this project.
