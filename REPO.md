# Activities and Lessons Learned

## Activities

1. **Code Modification**: Modified the existing Python script to report any bugs found during the fuzzing process to a CSV file called `fuzz_report.csv`.
   
2. **Error Handling**: Implemented error handling using `try-except` blocks to catch exceptions that occur during the fuzzing of each function.

3. **CSV File Writing**: Incorporated the `csv` module to handle writing bug information to the CSV file.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Error Handling Best Practices**: Learned the importance of implementing robust error handling mechanisms, especially when dealing with external dependencies or potential runtime errors.

2. **Logging and Reporting**: Recognized the significance of logging and reporting mechanisms in software development to track and document bugs, exceptions, and other issues encountered during execution.

3. **File Operations**: Gained experience in performing file operations such as appending data to CSV files and managing file naming conventions dynamically within a Python script.

4. **Documentation**: Reinforced the importance of documenting code changes and activities, ensuring clarity for future reference and collaboration.

5. **Testing and Validation**: Emphasized the significance of thorough testing and validation processes to identify and address potential issues early in the development lifecycle.

6. **Version Control Practices**: Practiced version control best practices by committing changes incrementally and utilizing meaningful commit messages to track modifications effectively.

7. **Continuous Improvement**: Highlighted the iterative nature of software development and the value of continuous improvement through feedback, experimentation, and adaptation.
