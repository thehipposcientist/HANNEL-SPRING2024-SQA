# Activities and Lessons Learned

## Activities

In this project we implement a git hook to check the python files before commiting. In this I used the bandit library to check for things like white space and syntax errors. From here I implemented a file to fuzztest several functions of my own choosing. I also added in for both checks to create error reports on csv files. 

## Lessons Learned

1. **Error Handling Best Practices**: Learned the importance of implementing robust error handling mechanisms, especially when dealing with external dependencies or potential runtime errors.

2. **Logging and Reporting**: Recognized the significance of logging and reporting mechanisms in software development to track and document bugs, exceptions, and other issues encountered during execution.

3. **File Operations**: Gained experience in performing file operations such as appending data to CSV files and managing file naming conventions dynamically within a Python script.

4. **Documentation**: Reinforced the importance of documenting code changes and activities, ensuring clarity for future reference and collaboration.

5. **Testing and Validation**: Emphasized the significance of thorough testing and validation processes to identify and address potential issues early in the development lifecycle.

6. **Version Control Practices**: Practiced version control best practices by committing changes incrementally and utilizing meaningful commit messages to track modifications effectively.

7. **Continuous Improvement**: Highlighted the iterative nature of software development and the value of continuous improvement through feedback, experimentation, and adaptation.
